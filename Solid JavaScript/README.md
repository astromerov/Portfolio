### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
<div>
  <p>
    While there are tons of materials and tutorials, I felt that systematic training contributes to the desired impact.
    HTML is really easy to learn, however, when it comes to learning about <strong>CSS</strong> such as flexbox, border etc,
    the situations get complex. On the other hand, JavaScript is just literally not easy to learn, whether your learn the fundamentals or
    the concept, without applying them by building something, it is just like a rocket science for a complete noobie.
